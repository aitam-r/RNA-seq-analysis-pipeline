* Shiny App
- Parellelism : sometimes only one core (=pickSoftThreshold=), sometimes all, (=build_network=, despite instructions)
- Integration of snakemake into the app (long)
- Make tximport work instead of tximeta
- Make the ui a bit more consistent (box or div everywhere)
- Make a enrichment thingy also for differential expression (interface it with gprofiler too)
- Highlight specific genes in the volcanoplot, see [[https://erikaduan.github.io/posts/2021-01-02-volcano-plots-with-ggplot2/]]
- Look to see if tximeta + summarizetoGene isn't doing the same thing twice


* Snakemake
- Include download as an option in the main snakemake
- Unite the two snakefile (paired/single) as a single file, and make the pair/single an option (how)
- Pipe cutadapt or just temp (which enables QC)?? Decide, or make it an option
- Use the config file for more things (threads, cutadapt QC)

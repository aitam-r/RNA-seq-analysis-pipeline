* Project set-up
** Directories
Scripts are in scripts, analysis contains mostly files generated by tools such as multiqc, data contains raw, intermediate data and counts.
** Steps
The steps of the pipeline are as follow :
1. Download with =prefetch= and decompress with =fastq-dump=
2. Quality control with =fastqc= and =multiqc=
3. Adapter trimming with =cutadapt= (and re - =fastqc=)
4. Pseudo-mapping and quantification with =salmon=
5. Importation/transcript quantification are done with =tximeta=
6. DEG analysis with =DESeq2=
7. Clustering analysis with =WGCNA=
** Workflow tools
- steps 2-3-4 are performed via =Snakemake=
- steps 5-6 through a =shiny= interface
